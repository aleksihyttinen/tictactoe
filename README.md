# tictactoe

Tictactoe is my first coding project ever and it was made as a part of my first year studies at TAMK.
The app is a tictactoe-game coded in Java, that runs in command prompt. There is a javadoc of the project included with the app.
You can find the instructions to run the app inside the project folder.
